Plain English Programming:  the CAL compiler, editor, writer, and desktop.

This version includes all of the core functionality
of the CAL Win32 compiler / editor / finder.
It also includes the lexicon and the source code of the instructions.
It does not include the sample project (Cal Monet).

It has the following features and limitations:
- It requires Win32 (such as Win XP, Win Vista, Win 7, or WINE).
- It is designed to be customized using Plain English programming.

The programming paradigm is "speak to a young child in plain English":
- Most statements are complete sentences.
- Mathematical notation is used as little as possible.
- Parentheses are rare; their main use is to distinguish
  procedures that share names and argument types.
